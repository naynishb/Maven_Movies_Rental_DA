### Customer Insights:

Identify customer details (names, emails) for targeted marketing campaigns.
Analyze customer rental patterns to improve customer engagement.

### Movie Inventory Analysis:

Explore the rental inventory and classify movies based on rental rates and availability.
Provide recommendations for expanding the movie collection based on popularity and rental rates.
Revenue Optimization:

Analyze rental rates to identify trends and the profitability of various pricing categories.
Determine the most rented movie categories and ratings to maximize revenue.

### Operational Efficiency:

Help track and manage movie inventory effectively.
Highlight gaps in the inventory and optimize stock levels.
